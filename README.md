## About

This repository serves as a portfolio of C programming projects I have worked on. It covers topics ranging from basic syntax and operations to advanced topics like data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Hello World**: A basic program to get started with C.
2. **Calculator**: A simple calculator for arithmetic operations.
3. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort.
4. **Linked List**: Operations on a singly/doubly linked list.
5. **File Handling**: Examples of reading from and writing to files.
6. **Memory Management**: Demonstrates usage of `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
7. **Game**: A simple command-line game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or Snake).
