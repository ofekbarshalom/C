# System Programming Assignment 2 - C Language

This project contains solutions to various programming tasks implemented in the C language. The focus of the assignment is on pointers, arrays, matrix operations, and algorithmic problem-solving using efficient techniques.

## Features

1. **Grade Management**
   - Read grades for 50 students.
   - Calculate the average grade.
   - Print grades above the average.

2. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Check if a given string is a palindrome.

3. **Matrix Transposition**
   - Transpose a square matrix in place.
   - Display the matrix before and after transposition.

4. **Magic Square Validation**
   - Validate if a square matrix is a magic square.
   - Print appropriate messages based on validation.

5. **Shortest Path in Adjacency Matrix**
   - Calculate the shortest path between two nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
   - Handle disconnected nodes gracefully.

6. **Knapsack Problem**
   - Solve the 0/1 knapsack problem.
   - Determine the maximum profit and which items to include.

7. **Pointer Subarray Size**
   - Calculate the size of a subarray between two pointers efficiently.

8. **Target Sum in Sorted Array**
   - Check if two numbers in a sorted array sum up to a target value.
   - Print the indices of the numbers if found.

9. **Cycle Detection in an Array**
   - Detect the first index of a loop in an array of jumps.

10. **Subarray Containment**
    - Check if one array is contained within another.
    - Return pointers to the start of the subarray.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler**: GCC or any other standard C compiler.
- **Make Utility**: For building the project.
